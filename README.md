## Term Project

This semester, my project is dedicated to Inventory Management with a primary focus on actions such as adding, modifying, and relocating items. This project aims to simplify these essential processes, leading to a more effective and well-organized inventory system. These improvements will result in time and cost savings, enhancing overall productivity. It's a project with a specific goal of optimizing our day-to-day operations.
